# CredLend: Borderless Loans for a Brighter Future

## The Story of Maria and David

Maria is a talented artisan in a small town in Southeast Asia. She creates beautiful handmade crafts and dreams of expanding her business to reach a global market. However, traditional banks in her region have high interest rates and complex application processes, making it difficult for her to get the loan she needs to buy more materials and build an online store.

Thousands of miles away, David, a software engineer in North America, has some stablecoins sitting in his digital wallet. He's looking for a way to earn a better return on his savings than what traditional banks offer, and he's passionate about supporting entrepreneurship in emerging markets.

This is where **CredLend** comes in.
